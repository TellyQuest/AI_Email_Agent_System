# 🧭 Best Coding Practices Checklist

Use this document to continuously evaluate and improve code quality across the project.

---

## 🧱 1. Code Organization & Structure

- [ ] Clear folder / module structure  
- [ ] One responsibility per file / class / function  
- [ ] No “god” classes or massive functions  
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions  
- [ ] No duplicated logic (DRY principle)

---

## 🧾 2. Readability & Maintainability

- [ ] Descriptive variable, function, class names  
- [ ] Functions are short and focused  
- [ ] Comments explain *why*, not *what*  
- [ ] No commented-out dead code  
- [ ] Consistent formatting / style

---

## 🧪 3. Testing & Reliability

- [ ] Unit tests for core logic  
- [ ] Edge cases tested  
- [ ] Tests are automated  
- [ ] Code is easy to test (no tight coupling)  
- [ ] No fragile tests

---

## 🧯 4. Error Handling & Stability

- [ ] All external calls are wrapped with error handling  
- [ ] Meaningful error messages  
- [ ] No silent failures  
- [ ] No swallowing of exceptions  
- [ ] Proper fallback behavior

---

## ⚙️ 5. Performance & Efficiency

- [ ] No unnecessary loops / computations  
- [ ] Efficient data structures used  
- [ ] Avoid premature optimization  
- [ ] Caching used where appropriate  
- [ ] No blocking operations on critical paths

---

## 🔐 6. Security Practices

- [ ] No secrets in source code  
- [ ] Input validation everywhere  
- [ ] Protection against injections  
- [ ] Authentication & authorization handled safely  
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted

---

## 🧩 7. Design Principles

- [ ] SOLID principles followed  
- [ ] Loose coupling, high cohesion  
- [ ] Dependency injection where useful  
- [ ] Clear interfaces / boundaries  
- [ ] Code is extensible without major rewrites

---

## 🧹 8. Clean Code Discipline

- [ ] No magic numbers / strings  
- [ ] Constants used appropriately  
- [ ] No unused variables / imports  
- [ ] No overly clever code  
- [ ] Code is boring and predictable (good thing)

---

## 📦 9. Version Control & Workflow

- [ ] Small, meaningful commits  
- [ ] Clear commit messages  
- [ ] No broken main branch  
- [ ] Code reviews in place  
- [ ] CI checks running

---

## 📚 10. Documentation

- [ ] README explains project setup & usage  
- [ ] Key decisions documented  
- [ ] Public APIs documented  
- [ ] Onboarding is easy for new developers
